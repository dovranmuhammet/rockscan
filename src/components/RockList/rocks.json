    "name": "Granite",
    "description": "Granite is a common type of igneous rock that is widely used in construction and architecture. It is formed through the slow crystallization of magma deep beneath the Earth's surface. With its unique combination of durability, beauty, and versatility, Granite has become a popular choice for countertops, flooring, monuments, and more.",
    "wikiImage": "https://images.schoolspecialty.com/images/586255_ecommfullsize.jpg",
    "formation": {
      "description": "Granite forms when molten magma cools and solidifies over long periods of time. The slow cooling allows large mineral crystals to form, resulting in Granite's distinctive coarse-grained texture."
    },
    "characteristics": {
      "color": "Granite comes in a wide range of colors, including shades of gray, pink, white, and black. The specific mineral composition determines the color variation.",
      "composition": "Granite is primarily composed of quartz, feldspar, and mica minerals. These minerals give Granite its durability, strength, and resistance to wear and tear.",
      "hardness": "Granite is a hard rock with a Mohs hardness rating of 6 to 7, making it highly resistant to scratching and abrasion.",
      "density": "Granite has a relatively high density, typically ranging from 2.6 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter.",
      "porosity": "Granite is known for its low porosity, which means it has very few open pores or cracks. This property makes it resistant to moisture absorption and staining."
    },
    "applications": {
      "construction": "Granite is widely used in construction for various purposes. It is a popular choice for countertops, flooring, wall cladding, and exterior facades due to its durability, heat resistance, and natural beauty.",
      "monuments": "Granite has been used for centuries in the construction of monuments and memorials. Its ability to withstand weathering and retain its polished appearance makes it a preferred material for lasting tributes.",
      "sculptures": "The strength and workability of Granite make it an excellent choice for sculptures and artistic creations. Many famous sculptures throughout history have been crafted from Granite."
    },
    "scientificSignificance": "Granite plays a significant role in geology and Earth sciences. It provides insights into the processes of magma crystallization, the formation of continents, and the dynamics of the Earth's crust. Granite is extensively studied to better understand the composition and evolution of the Earth's deep subsurface"
