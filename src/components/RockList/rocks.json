    "name": "Basalt",
    "description": "Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained igneous rock that is formed from the rapid cooling of lava at or near the Earth's surface. It is composed primarily of minerals such as pyroxene, plagioclase feldspar, and olivine. Basalt is known for its dense and durable nature, making it a common rock type in volcanic regions and oceanic crust. Its color ranges from dark gray to black. Basaltic lava flows can create extensive volcanic landscapes known as basalt plateaus or flood basalts. Basalt rock is commonly used in construction for its strength and resistance to weathering. It is used in the production of crushed stone, concrete aggregates, and asphalt for road construction. Basalt is also utilized in making statues, sculptures, and jewelry due to its aesthetic appeal. Basalt is found in many regions around the world, including volcanic areas and areas of recent volcanic activity.",
