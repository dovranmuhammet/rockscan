    "type": "Igneous",
    "formation": "Granite is created through the extraordinary forces of nature. It begins as molten magma deep beneath the Earth's surface. As tectonic plates shift and collide, magma rises and forms immense underground chambers. Inside these chambers, under immense pressure, the magma cools slowly, allowing the minerals within to crystallize and interlock, giving rise to the remarkable structure and strength of granite.",
