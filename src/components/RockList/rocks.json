    "description": "Lignite is a type of coal that is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low carbon content and energy density. It is a soft, brownish-black sedimentary rock that forms from the compression of peat over millions of years. Lignite contains a high amount of moisture and volatile matter, which makes it less energy-dense compared to other types of coal. It is primarily composed of carbonized plant material, such as wood and peat, and it often exhibits a woody texture and fibrous structure. Lignite is commonly used as a fuel for power generation and in industrial processes, but its low heat value and high moisture content make it less efficient than higher-rank coals. It is also used as a source of heat in residential heating systems. Lignite deposits are found in various parts of the world, particularly in areas with ancient swamps and marshes. Due to its high moisture content, lignite requires special handling and storage to prevent spontaneous combustion. Despite its lower quality compared to higher-rank coals, lignite remains an important energy resource in regions where it is abundant.",

    "name": "Dunite",
    "description": "Dunite is a type of ultramafic rock primarily composed of the mineral olivine. It is a coarse-grained rock that has a greenish-yellow to olive-green color, often with a speckled appearance. The predominant mineral olivine gives dunite its characteristic composition and texture. Dunite is rich in magnesium and iron, with olivine typically comprising more than 90% of its composition. Due to its high magnesium content, dunite is considered an ultramafic rock and is closely related to peridotite. Dunite is primarily formed through the solidification of magma deep within the Earth's mantle, and it is often associated with tectonic processes such as the uplifting and erosion of oceanic lithosphere. Its coarse-grained nature indicates slow cooling and crystallization. Dunite is commonly found in mantle-derived igneous complexes, such as ophiolites, where it represents the residue left behind after the extraction of basaltic magma. It is also associated with certain types of volcanic eruptions, particularly those related to mantle plumes. In addition, dunite is used as a refractory material due to its high melting point and resistance to heat and corrosion.",

Aplite forms when magma intrudes into existing rock formations and undergoes rapid cooling and crystallization near the Earth's surface. The fine-grained nature of aplite suggests its formation through relatively fast cooling rates. It often occurs as dikes or veins that cut across other rocks, indicating its intrusive origin. Aplite is commonly associated with granite and is considered a granitic rock. It is often found in regions with extensive granite intrusions, such as mountain ranges or granite batholiths. Aplite is used as a decorative stone and can be polished to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Due to its high quartz content, aplite is sometimes quarried for its silica, which is used in the production of glass and ceramics.",
